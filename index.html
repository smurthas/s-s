				<p>Simon and Sarah met in 1995, after Sarah's brother
        Matt and Simon began playing football together at recess. Sarah can't
        remember exactly when they met (Simon was short and had a ponytail so
        he wasn't exactly on her radar), but she remembers him visiting her in
        college and playing
        flip cup at her graduation party. Simon's first memory of Sarah is when
        she punched him in the arm and said he needed to "toughen up" (he did).
        Thirteen years later they re-found each other the night before
        Thanksgiving in Hartford, CT.
        </p>

        <p>A few weeks later Simon visited Sarah in New York for a magical
        flannel-filled Christmas date. That's when they knew this was the start
        of something special.
        </p>

        <p>For the next two years they chased each other around New England,
        co-habitated briefly in Brooklyn, and eventually made it to San
        Francisco hand in hand. Their life together has been an adventure, and
        they are excited for the next part of the ride: marriage! </p>

      A note on dress code: A portion of the wedding will be outside and San
      Francisco is always about 55-60 degrees. Please wear a sweater or bring a
      jacket!
      </p>

			<p>
			The wedding is taking place in the Mission District of San Francisco. There are not many hotels nearby so
      we recommend using <a href='http://www.airbnb.com/'>Airbnb</a> to find a place.</p>

			<p>Due to the small size of our wedding, blocking rooms is not an option. Please feel free to also check out the following hotels:
			</p>

      <strong>The Prescott Hotel </strong><br/>
			545 Post Street <br/>
			San Francisco, CA 94102 <br/>

      <br>
      San Francisco is an incredible city with so many adventures to <br>be had!
      If you have some time before or after the wedding, here <br>are some of our
        favorite things to do:
      <div class="right_col">

        <p><strong>Ferry Building/Embarcadero.</strong>
        Begin your stroll anywhere along the Embarcadero (a walkway that runs the
        length of the city next to the Bay and features great views of the Bay
        Bridge) and end up at the Ferry Building to check out local SF shops!
        <a href="www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com">more info</a></p>

        <p><strong>Sutro Baths and Lands End.</strong>
        If you want a little exercise head over to Lands End for a hike with
        amazing views of the  Marin Headlands. Afterwards walk down to Sutro Baths
        to play along these old ruins and touch the Pacific! <a
          href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sutro-baths-san-francisco">more info</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Twin Peaks.</strong>
        For the best views in the city, drive up to Twin Peaks. It's amazing at
        sunset! <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/twin-peaks-san-francisco">more
          info</a>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Take a walk on the Wild Side in the Castro.</strong>
        Start at 16th and Castro and walk up Castro street to find the old camera
        store (now a Human Rights Campaign office) that Harvey Milk launched his
        political career in. You will definitely see things in the Castro that
        you won't believe!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mexican in the Mission. </strong>We will be spending lots of
        wedding time in the Mission but try to make it to 24th street (before
        dark!) to try authentic burritos. Any place you find will be great or
        use yelp.com.
        </p>

      </div>

      <p><strong>Golden Gate Bridge. </strong>No trip to San Francisco is
      complete without stopping to see this man-made treasure. Our favorite
      thing to do is to <a href="www.blazingsaddles.com">rent bicycles</a> and
      bike along Marina Green to get up and over the bridge. <a
        href="goldengatebridge.org">more info</a>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Fisherman's Wharf. </strong>See the sea lions at Pier 39 bark
      at each other then wander further down to Fisherman's Wharf to grab a
      bowl of chowder and check out this water-front community. <a
        href="http://www.fishermanswharf.org/">more info</a>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ride a Cable Car. </strong>Riding a cable car is an absolute
      blast. Our favorite route is along the Powell-Mason line. It drops you
      off by Union Square so you can do a little shopping if you're craving
      some hipster style. <a href="http://www.sfcablecar.com">more info</a>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Grab a Cappucino or Slice of Pizza in North Beach. </strong>
      North Beach is the Italian mecca of San Francisco. If you're craving
      pizza or canolis, head here! <a
        href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/neighborhood/north-beach/">more
        info</a>
      </p>

      <p><strong>Dim Sum in Chinatown or Ramen Noodles in Japan Town (at Suzu
        Noodle House). </strong>SF has a large asian immigrant community with
      delicious restaurants all over. In Chinatown head to Grant and Jackson
      and eat wherever! Suzu is our favorite Ramen place on Geary &amp; Webster.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Get your fill of SF's hippie counter culture in Haight
        Ashbury.</strong>
      Also a great spot for Vintage clothing!
      </p>

        Registry?
			</div>

			<p>
      We aren't doing a registry. We have all we need in each other! We also
      appreciate our guests making the effort to join us out in San Francisco
      and feel your presence is our present!
      </p>
      <p>
      If you wish to give us a gift we
      are saving up for our trekking honeymoon in Chile and our favorite stores
      include Anthropologie and West Elm. We also encourage donations made on
      our behalf to New Door Ventures (where Sarah volunteers in SF). Hope that
      helps :)
